        The project focuses on developing a credit scoring system for Upay users
        using machine learning techniques, leveraging various data sources to
        predict loan eligibility with precision. This system aims to streamline
        loan disbursement decisions and provide valuable insights to
        decision-makers. Additionally, an automated user interface is being
        developed to facilitate faster decision-making.
